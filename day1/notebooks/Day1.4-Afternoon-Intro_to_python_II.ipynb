    "## Functions\n",
    "Many times when writing programs, you will find yourself doing the same task(s) over and over again. Functions allow you to create reuseable pieces of your programs so you can run a block of specificed code anywhere in your program, as many times as you need, with any modifications or variables that you might need. As an example, lets start by figuring out what the GC% is for a given nucleic acid string.  To do this, we will need to learn the length of the oligonucleotide sequence, as well as the number of 'G' and 'C' bases.  Lets start by figuring out a way to do this for one DNA sequence."

You can also develop your own modules to split projects/workflows in to manageable pieces for easier maintenance and reusability.\n",

For example, if you have a python file named `sequencing.py` you can import the file/module with the name `sequencing`.\n",
